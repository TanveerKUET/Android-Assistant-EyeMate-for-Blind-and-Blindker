# Android-Assistant-EyeMate-for-Blind-and-Blindker
At present many blind assistive systems have been implemented but there is no such kind of good system to navigate a blind person and also to track the movement of a blind person and rescue him/her if he/she is lost. In this paper, we have presented a blind assistive and tracking embedded system. In this system the blind person is navigated through a spectacle interfaced with an android application. The blind person is guided through Bengali/English voice commands generated by the application according to the obstacle position. Using voice command a blind person can establish voice call to a predefined number without touching the phone just by pressing the headset
button. The blind assistive application gets the latitude and longitude using GPS and then sends them to a server. The movement of the blind person is tracked through another android application that points out the current position in Google map. We took distances from several surfaces like concrete and tiles floor in our experiment where the error rate is 5%.
